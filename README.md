# Tasks

## High Priority

### Admin:

#### Loan Application:
- Redesign the loan application form to be thinner and more compact, presenting inputs in a table-like format with modern styling (without using an actual table unless it maintains the same aesthetic).  

- Initially, display only the first 10 loan applications, with a "View More" button to load additional applications. This prevents the page from being overwhelming.
### Client:
#### Loan Applications:
- Apply the same redesign to the loan application form as the Admin panel (thinner, table-like structure with modern styling).  
- Display only the first 10 loan applications initially, with a "View More" button for better page organization.
